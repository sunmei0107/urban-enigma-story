In the Mojava Desert, there is a mysterious city.
The city appears in the desert every 4 years and disppeared very soom.
No one knows the name of the city.
People who have been in the city have never been out.
So my 3 best friends and I decided to go looking for it, and we couldn't have made a bigger mistake. We expected jewels and precious metals, instead we found that the city doesn't disappear to keep people out, it does so to keep it's inhabitatns in.
