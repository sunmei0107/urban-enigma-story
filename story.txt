In the Mojava Desert, there is a mysterious city.
The city appears in the desert every 4 years and disppeared very soom.
No one knows the name of the city.
People who have been in the city have never been out.
So my 3 best friends and I decided to go looking for it, and we couldn't have made a bigger mistake. We expected jewels and precious metals, instead we found that the city doesn't disappear to keep people out, it does so to keep it's inhabitatns in.

We probably should have known to not go in since nobody ever comes out. Also, when we approached, there were shady looking sand people at the entrance. We saw them from a distance but kept approaching for some reason. Then when we got close they started screeching and captured us.

Once captured they took us to an underground dungeon.  We had no idea where we were.  The people there talked in a language noone could understand.  We assumed they were trying to figure out what to do with us.

It became apparent that the sand people were in charge.  They spoke in a language similar to none other that we had heard before.  Between their squeaks and whistles, there was one word that sounded familiar to us--"kill."  We knew we had made a mistake.
